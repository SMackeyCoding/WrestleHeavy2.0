            <p>Most wrestlers portray character roles, sometimes with personalities wildly different from their own. These personalities are a gimmick intended to heighten interest in a wrestler without regard to athletic ability. Some can be unrealistic (such as Kane or The Undertaker), while others may adopt a more "real" persona (such as Chris Jericho or The Rock).</p>
